## Simple Factory
---

Factory DP is used when we want to create an object based on some parameters.

```
1. Create a common interface for the type that we want to use.
Example: Button interface

2. Create concrete class.
Example: Primary Button, Secondary Button

3. Create a factory class
   - static method to create instance
   - conditionally create objects 
```
